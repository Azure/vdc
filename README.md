# Azure Virtual Datacenter

_Enabling developer agility and operational consistency without compromising security and governance._

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Azure/vdc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Azure/vdc)

Microsoft Azure Virtual Datacenter (VDC) is an approach for designing a foundational cloud architecture for enterprises. It provides a vision for enterprise IT in the cloud and a strategy for implementing it. For more information about the approach, visit [Azure Virtual Datacenter](https://aka.ms/vdc).

The VDC approach is composed of three main components:
- A set of reference architectures
- An engagement model that guides customers on choosing the right reference architectures
- An automation toolkit that follows the engagement model to provide a DevOps approach on deploying different reference architectures

## Automation Toolkit

This repository contains the _Azure Virtual Datacenter Automation Toolkit_. The toolkit is set of deployment artifacts, Azure Resource Manager templates and scripts, and an orchestration engine. It allows you to deploy an example shared services infrastructure environment and example workload environments capable of hosting different applications. It also allows you to deploy a simulated on-premises environment, hosted in Azure, for testing purposes.
