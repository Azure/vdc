# Deploying the simulated on-premises environment

All of the sample shared services and spoke deployments included in the VDC Automation
Toolkit are preconfigured to work with a simulated on-premises
environment by default. 

This environment provides a basic Azure hosted virtual network with a VPN
gateway and hosting a single VM. This VM is configured as the Contoso primary
domain controller and will provide domain services to the entire VDC once the
shared services network is connected to this simulated on-premises environment. As the VDC
will be isolated, the only way to access VDC hosted workloads or network
resources will be through the domain controller VM after the shared services network is
connected.

If you're planning to use a simulated on-premises, deploy it before starting the
sample shared services deployment.

## Prerequisite: create and configure your parameters file

As discussed in the [parameter files](03-parameters-files.md#parameters-files) topic, the VDC Automation Toolkit provides a default test version of the top-level deployment parameter file. You will need to create a new version of this file before running your deployment. 

To do this, navigate to the toolkit's [archetypes/on-premises](../archetypes/on-premises) folder, then make a copy of the *azureDeploy.test.parameters.json*, and name this copy *azureDeploy.parameters.json*. Then proceed to edit azureDeploy.parameters.json providing the subscription, organization, networking, and other configuration information that you want to use for your deployment. Make sure you use values for the shared services parameters consistent with your intended shared services deployment.

If your copy of the toolkit is associated with a git repository, the [.gitignore](../.gitignore) file provided by the default VDC Automation Toolkit is set to prevent your deployment azureDeploy.parameters.json file from being pushed to your code repository.

Note: The `deployment-user-id` is the user's azure active directory object id.

## Run the deployment

Start the "on-premises" deployment by running the following command in the terminal
or command-line interface:

[Linux/OSX]

>   *python3 vdc.py create on-premises -path
>   "archetypes/on-premises/archetype.json" --upload-scripts*

[Windows]

>   *py vdc.py create on-premises -path
>   "archetypes/on-premises/archetype.json" --upload-scripts*

[Docker]

>   *python vdc.py create on-premises -path
>   "archetypes/on-premises/archetype.json" --upload-scripts*

This deployment creates two resource groups:

*{organization name}-{deployment name}-onprem-net-rg* - hosting the networking resources for the simulated on-premises environment. These resources are described in the following table.

| **Resource**                                                      | **Type**                | **Description**                                                                    |

| {organization name}-{deployment name}-gw-pip                      | Public IP address       | Publicly accessible IP address used by the gateway.                                |

*{organization name}-{deployment name}-onprem-ad-rg* - hosting the active directory servers and related resources used in the simulated on-premises environment. These resources are described in the following table.

| **Resource**                                                      | **Type**                | **Description**                                                                    |

| {organization name}-{deployment name}-ad-vm-nic-pip               | Public IP address       | Public endpoint that allows you to access the simulated domain server VM remotely. |
