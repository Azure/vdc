= File formatting in the documentation

Many of the files in the toolkit's documentation use the https://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/[AsciiDoc format]. This format was chosen over markdown because it is easier to manage certain structures such as tables and notes. Currently, the documentation is a mixture of markdown and AsciiDoc since we only converted files that required the new format.
