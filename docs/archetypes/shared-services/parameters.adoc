= Shared-services deployment parameters

These parameters are used to deploy the simulated on-premises environment. They are located in the `general` section of the `archetype.json` configuration file.

== On-premises settings

These are located under `general.on-premises`. 

NOTE: Some of these setting are only required when using the Azure hosted simulated on-premises environment.

== Shared services settings

These are located under `general.shared-services`. 

[options="header",cols="a,,a"]
|===
| Parameter name | Type | Description

| `subscription-id`
| Subscription ID (GUID)
| ID of the subscription to deploy the shared services resources to.

| `deployment-name`
| String
| Shorthand name for the shared services environment. Used as a secondary naming prefix when provisioning resources. This name should be unique among your organization’s shared services instances. If you use a duplicate name, the deployment will overwrite existing deployments or not complete successfully. This value should not contain spaces but may contain dashes and underscores.

| `region`
| String
| The Azure region where shared services resources are deployed (for example, `West US` or `France South`).

View the https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/[full list of regions].

| `ancillary-region`
| String
| Alternate Azure region where the operations and monitoring resources are deployed. This should not be the same as the region where the shared services environment is hosted to ensure redundancy.

View the https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/[full list of regions].

| `gateway-type`
| String
| Specifies the type of connection with the on-premises network; either `vpn` or `expressroute`.

| `gateway-sku`
| String
| Specifies the Gateway SKU used. Allowable values:

- `Basic`
- `VpnGw1`
- `VpnGw2`
- `VpnGw3`

See https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpn-gateway-settings#gwsku[Gateway SKU] for more details.

| `vpn-type`
| String 
| Specifies the https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-connect-multiple-policybased-rm-ps#about-policy-based-and-route-based-vpn-gateways[type of VPN gateway] used to connect with the shared services network; either `RouteBased` or `PolicyBased`.

| `enable-ddos-protection`
| String
| Specifies if https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/ddos-protection-overview[Azure DDoS Protection] is enabled on the shared services virtual network automatically on creation.

| `azure-firewall-private-ip`
| IPV4 address
| IP address assigned to the Azure Firewall controlling access to the Internet.

| `ubuntu-nva-lb-ip-address`
| IPV4 address
| IP address assigned to the Linux VM-based firewall controlling access to the Internet. 

_Optional. Used when deploying Ubuntu VM for firewall purposes._

| `ubuntu-nva-address-start`
| IPV4 address
| IP address assigned to the Linux VM-based firewall controlling access to the Internet. 

_Optional. Used when deploying Ubuntu VM for firewall purposes._

| `squid-nva-address-start`
| IPV4 address
| IP address assigned to the Squid proxy NVA. 

_Optional. Used when deploying a Squid NVA for proxy services._

| `domain-admin-user`
| String
| Domain user with rights to add trust relationship between on-premises domain and domain controllers hosted in the shared services environment. 

Note that to prevent conflicts when Key Vault stores this user information as a secret, `domain-admin-user` must be different than `local-admin-user`.

| `domain-name`
| String
| The domain name used by your on-premises network.

| `local-admin-user`
| String
| User account to create as local admin on VMs created within the shared services. 

Note that to prevent conflicts when Key Vault stores this user information as a secret, `domain-admin-user` must be different than `local-admin-user`.

| `keyvault.secrets` > "${general.shared-services.vm-configuration.local-admin-user}"
| String
| Contains `local-admin-user` password information  

| `keyvault.secrets` > "${general.on-premises.active-directory.domain-admin-user}"
| String
| Contains `domain-admin-user` password information  

| `keyvault.secrets` > "self-certificate-base64"
| String
| Contains SSL certificate as Base64, this information is used in an App Gateway deployment

| `keyvault.secrets` > "self-certificate-password"
| String
| Contains SSL certificate password, this information is used in an App Gateway deployment

| `adds-address-start`
| IPV4 address 
| IP address for the first ADDS server deployed to the shared services subnet. Additional servers use an IP address incremented from this starting address.

| `enable-encryption`
| Boolean
| Determines if virtual disks are automatically encrypted on creation. Only Windows VM encryption is supported. When this value is set to true, the toolkit will use the values from `encryption-keys-for` to create certificates in Key Vault.

| `network`
| link:../../use/common-parameters.adoc#network-parameters[Network object]
| The configuration for the shared services virtual network. 

Note that for the hub network, the subnet entries for the _AzureFirewallSubnet_ and _GatewaySubnet_ subnets are required and should not be modified from the versions in the sample configuration file.

| `encryption-keys-for`
| String[Array]
| Lists the module names that need encryption keys to be generated in Key Vault. If modules are specified, the toolkit will create certificates in Key Vault. These certificates are passed to a VM deployment to provide BitLocker encryption (only Windows encryption VMs are supported). 

This parameter is only used by the toolkit when `enable-encryption` is set to true.

| `module-dependencies`
| link:../../use/common-parameters.adoc#module-dependency-parameters[Module Dependencies object] 
| This object defines the locations, dependencies, and behavior of resource modules used for a deployment.
