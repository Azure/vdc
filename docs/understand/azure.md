Before using the Azure Virtual Datacenter Automation Toolkit, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the following core Azure technologies and services:

- [Azure Resource Manager][]
- [Azure Resource Manager Templates][]
- [Azure CLI][]
- [Azure subscriptions and Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-how-subscriptions-associated-directory) _(Azure AD)_

In addition to these, you should also be familiar with any Azure services you will be deploying.
