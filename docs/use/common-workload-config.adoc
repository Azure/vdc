| `azure-firewall-name`
| IPV4 address
| Name of the Azure Firewall controlling access to the Internet.

| `ubuntu-nva-lb-ip-address`
| IPV4 address
| IP address assigned to the Linux VM-based firewall controlling access to the Internet.

_Optional. Used when deploying Ubuntu VM for firewall purposes._

| `ubuntu-nva-address-start`
| IPV4 address
| IP address assigned to the Linux VM-based firewall controlling access to the Internet.

`Optional. Used when deploying Ubuntu VM for firewall purposes.`

| IP address for the first ADDS server deployed to the shared services shared services subnet. Additional servers use an IP address incremented from this starting address.

| `domain-name`
| String
| Domain name used by your on-premises network.

| `domain-admin-user`
| String
| Domain user with rights to add trust relationship between on-premises domain and hosted domain controllers.
|===

Note that to prevent conflicts when Key Vault stores this user information as a secret, `domain-admin-user` must be different than `local-admin-user`.

=== Workload parameters

[cols="a,,a", options="header"]
|===
| Parameter name | Type | Description 

| `subscription-id`
| Subscription ID (GUID)
| ID of the subscription that workload resources are deployed to.

| `deployment-name`
| String
| Shorthand name of the workload. Used as a secondary naming prefix when provisioning resources. This must be unique among your organization’s deployments. If you use a duplicate name, the deployment will overwrite existing deployments or not complete successfully. This value should not contain spaces but may contain dashes and underscores.

| `domain-name`
| String
| Domain name used by your on-premises network.

| `region`
| String
| The Azure region where shared services resources are deployed (for example, `West US` or `France South`).

View the https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/[full list of regions].

| `ancillary-region`
| String
| Alternate Azure region where the operations and monitoring resources are deployed. This should not be the same as the region where the workload environment is hosted to ensure redundancy.

View the https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/[full list of regions].

| `log-analytics-region`
| String
| Azure region where log analytics instance is hosted.

| `enable-encryption`
| Boolean
| Determines if virtual disks are automatically encrypted on creation. Only Windows VM encryption is supported. When this value is set to true, the toolkit will use the values from `encryption-keys-for` to create certificates in Key Vault.

| `enable-ddos-protection`
| String
| Specifies if https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/ddos-protection-overview[Azure DDoS Protection] is enabled on the workload virtual network automatically on creation.

| `local-admin-user`
| String
| User account to create as local admin on VMs created within the workload.

Note that to prevent conflicts when Key Vault stores this user information as a secret, `domain-admin-user` must be different than `local-admin-user`. 

| `vnet-address-prefix`
| CIDR range
| A CIDR range definition for the workload virtual network. This range must not overlap with the on-premises network, the shared services network, or any other workload network ranges. 

| `network`
| link:common-parameters.adoc#network-parameters[Network object]
| The configuration for the shared services virtual network. 

| `encryption-keys-for`
| String[Array]
| Lists the module names that need encryption keys to be generated in Key Vault. If modules are specified, the toolkit will create certificates in Key Vault. These certificates are passed to a VM deployment to provide BitLocker encryption (only Windows encryption VMs are supported). 

This parameter is only used by the toolkit when `enable-encryption` is set to true.

| `module-dependencies`
| link:common-parameters.adoc#module-dependency-parameters[Module Dependencies object] 
| This object defines the locations, dependencies, and behavior of resource modules used for a deployment.
