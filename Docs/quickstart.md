# Toolkit Quickstart Guide

This guide will walk you through deploying one of the example archetypes provided in the toolkit.
Specifically, we will deploy a [shared services](../Environments/SharedServices) that does not depend on an on-premises environment.

## Prerequisites

At a minimum you will need the following to complete this quickstart:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

We recommended [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as well, though any text editor will suffice.

You can install these on your local machine or you can use the lab VM provided in the toolkit.
See these instructions for [setting up the lab VM](../LabVM/README.md).

After these prerequisties are installed, we will [clone the reposistory on GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository-from-github) and [build a Docker image](https://docs.docker.com/glossary/?term=build).
This quickstart assumes that you will be interacting with the toolkit through the Docker image.

## Deploy Shared Services

**Follow the steps [from here](./environments/sharedservices/../../../Environments/SharedServices/readme.md) to deploy Shared Services environment**

### Next steps

Congratulations! You've deployed your first environment with the VDC Toolkit.
