# Script Reference

There are four Python scripts provided by the toolkit.

- [policy-assignment.py](script-policy-assignment.adoc) Update subscription policy post-deployment
- [role-creation.py](script-role-creation.adoc) Create subscription roles
- [subscription.py](script-subscription.adoc) Create management groups and subscriptions
- [vdc.py](script-vdc.adoc) Deploy archetypes and modules

You will need to [authenticate with Azure](script-auth.adoc) on the terminal or command line before invoking any of the scripts.

To understand how these scripts are used, read about the [common workflow](../understand/workflow.md) in the toolkit.
