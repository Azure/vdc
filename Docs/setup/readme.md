# Setting up the toolkit

We recommend using the Docker image provided in this GitHub repository to run the toolkit.
However, you can run the toolkit locally if you choose.
After getting the toolkit setup, you'll be ready to make your first deployment with the toolkit.

1. [Run the Docker image](setup-docker.md)
1. [Run on your local machine](setup-local.md)

## Next steps

- Now that the toolkit is setup, learn more about [how to use it](../use/readme.md).
- If you are eager to get started, then you can jump straight to [your first deployment](../use/your-first-deployment.md).
