= Archetype: Hadoop deployment
:toc:
:toc-placement: auto
:toclevels: 2

This archetype is based on the https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/hortonworks-extends-iaas-offering-on-azure-with-cloudbreak/[Cloudbreak] managed Hadoop deployment, which takes advantage of Azureâ€™s managed https://azure.microsoft.com/services/postgresql/[Database for PostgreSQL] and link:[https://azure.microsoft.com/services/mysql/[Database for MySQL] offerings.

== Create your archetype configuration file

The toolkit provides an example configuration file for the shared services environment. You will need to create a new version of this file before running your deployment.

1. Navigate to the toolkit's link:../../../archetypes/cloudbreak[archetypes/cloudbreak] folder.
1. Make a copy of the `archetype.test.json` and name the copy `archetype.json`.
1. Edit `archetype.json` providing the subscription, organization, networking, and other configuration information that you want to use for your deployment. You will need to use some of the same values when creating the configuration for the shared services environment.

If your copy of the toolkit is associated with the git repository, the link:../../../.gitignore[.gitignore] file is set to prevent your deployment `archetype.json` file from being pushed to your code repository.

== Run the deployment

This archetype includes a set of resources (Log Analytics, Key Vault, and VNet) for integrating with the shared service environment. The following steps will deploy these required resources.

=== Step 1: Deploy workload operations and monitoring resources

*Required role: SysOps*

This step provisions the operations and monitoring resources for the workload environment.

Start the `la` module by running the following command in the terminal or command-line interface:

.Docker
[source,bash]
python vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/cloudbreak/archetype.json -m la

.Linux/OSX
[source,bash]
python3 vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/cloudbreak/archetype.json -m la

.Windows
[source,cmd]
py vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/cloudbreak/archetype.json -m la

This deployment creates the `{org}-{deployment-name}-la-rg` resource group that hosts the resources described in the following table.

[options="header",cols="a,,"]
|===
| Resource | Type | Description

| `{org}-{deployment-name}-la`
| Log Analytics
| Log Analytics instance for monitoring the workload's network.
|===

=== Step 2: Deploy Key Vault

*Required role: SecOps*

The next step is deploying the kv module, which creates a Key Vault resource and stores secrets defined in the `archetype.json` as well as creating encryption keys (used in Azure Disk Encryption extension), that other resources will use in subsequent deployment steps.

These values are stored as secrets in the vault. To modify the default values for these passwords edit the link:../../../modules/kv/1.0/azureDeploy.parameters.json[Key Vault (kv) module parameters file] and update the secrets-object parameter.

Start the `kv` deployment by running the following command in the terminal or command-line interface:

.Docker
[source,bash]
python vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/cloudbreak/archetype.json -m kv

.Linux/OSX
[source,bash]
python3 vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/cloudbreak/archetype.json -m kv

.Windows
[source,cmd]
py vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/cloudbreak/archetype.json -m kv

This deployment creates the `{org}-{deployment-name}-kv-rg` resource group that hosts the resources described in the following table.

[options="header",cols="a,,"]
|===
| Resource | Type | Description

| `{org}-{deployment-name}-kv` 
| Key Vault
| Key Vault instance for the workload. One certificate deployed by default.

| `{org}{deployment-name}kvdiag` (with any dashes removed)
| Storage account
| Location of Key Vault audit logs.
|===

=== Step 3: Deploy the virtual network

*Required role: NetOps*

This step involves two resource deployments in the following order:

- The `nsg` module creates the network security groups (NSGs) and Azure security groups (ASGs) that secure the workload's virtual network. By default, the example workload net deployment creates a set of NSGs and ASGs compatible with an n-tier application, consisting of web, business, and data tiers. 
- The `workload-net` module creates the workload's virtual network, along with setting up the default subnet and User Defined Routes (UDRs) used to route traffic to the shared services network. This deployment also creates the VNet peering that connects the shared services and workload networks.

Start the `nsg` deployment by running the following command in the terminal or command-line interface:

.Docker
[source,bash]
python vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/cloudbreak/archetype.json -m nsg

.Linux/OSX
[source,bash]
python3 vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/cloudbreak/archetype.json -m nsg

.Windows
[source,cmd]
py vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/cloudbreak/archetype.json -m nsg

Then start the `workload-net` deployment by running the following command in the terminal or command-line interface:

.Docker
[source,bash]
python vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/cloudbreak/archetype.json -m workload-net

.Linux/OSX
[source,bash]
python3 vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/cloudbreak/archetype.json -m workload-net

.Windows
[source,cmd]
py vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/cloudbreak/archetype.json -m workload-net

These deployment creates the `{org}-{deployment-name}-net-rg` resource group that hosts the resources described in the following table.

[options="header",cols="a,,a"]
|===
| Resource | Type | Description

|`{org}-{deployment-name}-business-asg`
| Application security group
| ASG for business-tier resources.

| `{org}-{deployment-name}-data-asg`
| Application security group
| ASG for data-tier resources.

| `{org}-{deployment-name}-web-asg`
| Application security group
| ASG for web-tier resources.

| `{org}-{deployment-name}-vnet`
| Virtual network
| The primary workload's virtual network with a single default subnet.

| `{org}-{deployment-name}-{defaultsubnetname}-nsg`
| Network security group
| Network security group attached to the default subnet.

| `{org}-{deployment-name}-udr`
| Route table
| User Defined Routes for routing traffic to and from the shared services network.

| `{org}{deployment-name}diag{random-characters}` (with any dashes removed)
| Storage account 
| Storage location for virtual network diagnostic data.
|===

== Deploy workload resources

Once the workload operations, Key Vault, and virtual network resources are provisioned, your team can begin deploying actual workload resources. Performing the following tasks provisions the availability sets, virtual machines, Azure PostgreSQL, and Azure MySQL resources needed to deploy a virtual machine running a Cloudbreak managed Hadoop application.

A local user account will be created for these machines. The user name is defined in the `local-admin-user` parameter of the archetype configuration file. The password for this user is generated and stored in the workload's key vault as part of the `kv` deployment.

=== Deploy Hadoop Cloudbreak resources

Start the `cb` deployment by running the following command in the terminal or command-line interface:

.Docker
[source,bash]
python vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/cloudbreak/archetype.json -m cb

.Linux/OSX
[source,bash]
python3 vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/cloudbreak/archetype.json -m cb

.Windows
[source,cmd]
py vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/cloudbreak/archetype.json -m cb

These deployment creates the `{org}-{deployment-name}-cb-rg` resource group that hosts the resources described in the following table.

[options="header",cols="a,,a"]
|===
| Resource | Type | Description

| `cb-as`
| Availability set
| Availability set for Hadoop virtual machines.

| `{org}-{deployment-name}cb{random-characters}`
| Storage account
| Storage account for Hadoop Cloudbreak VM.

| `{org}-{deployment-name}-hdp-cb-vm1-nic1`
| Network interface
| Network interface for VM.
|===

=== Deploy Kerberos Domain Controller (KDC)

To enable Kerberos authentication for your Hadoop application, you will need a server in the workload virtual network capable of handling authentication claims. This resource deployment will create a two VMs
and an availability set to support a primary and secondary Kerberos Domain Controller that your Hadoop app can use for authentication.

Start the `kdc` deployment by running the following command in the terminal or command-line interface:

.Docker
[source,bash]
python vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/cloudbreak/archetype.json -m kdc

.Linux/OSX
[source,bash]
python3 vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/cloudbreak/archetype.json -m kdc

.Windows
[source,cmd]
py vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/cloudbreak/archetype.json -m kdc

These deployment creates the `{org}-{deployment-name}-kdc-rg` resource group that hosts the resources described in the following table.

[options="header",cols="a,,a"]
